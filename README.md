# Self-Supervsion on ADHD
Significant advancements have been made in the field of deep learning for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) classification using rsfMRI data. However, the existing methodologies often perform inadequately on Out Of Distribution (OOD) data when deployed in a clinical setting. Furthermore, the computational cost of 3D CNN restricts existing spatio-temporal deep learning methods to capturing temporal relations only within a subset of the fMRI time series.To address these limitations, we propose a novel spatio-temporal method that learn self-supervised spatial features through self-distillation and carries temporal learning of spatial features randomly sampled from different temporal neighborhoods with a transformer. This eliminates repetitive features and enables processing of the entire fMRI time series to learn discriminant features robust to distribution shifts in the data. The proposed method is validated through extensive experiments on the ADHD-200 dataset. It outperforms the previous state-of-the-art across all unit sites in a leave-one-site-out evaluation.
